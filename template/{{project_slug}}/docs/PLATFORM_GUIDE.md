## Step 1: Enable Multi-Tenancy

The scaffold ships with `AuthContext` that propagates `tenant_id` to all routes. By default, everything is `"default"`. To enable real multi-tenancy:

### 1a. Replace API key auth with JWT/OIDC

Edit `src/<project>/api/middleware/auth.py`. Replace the API key logic in `verify_api_key` with your identity provider:

```python
async def verify_api_key(
    request: Request,
    credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials | None = Security(security_scheme),
) -> AuthContext:
    # Replace this with your identity provider
    # Example: decode JWT, extract tenant_id and role
    if credentials is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Missing credentials")

    payload = decode_jwt(credentials.credentials)  # Your JWT decoder
    return AuthContext(
        api_key=credentials.credentials,
        user_id=payload["sub"],
        tenant_id=payload["org_id"],      # Maps to tenant isolation
        # Add custom fields as needed:
        # role=payload.get("role", "viewer"),
    )
```

Every route in the system already receives `AuthContext` -- no other changes needed for tenant identification.

> **SECURITY: JWT Verification**
> - Always verify the JWT signature cryptographically against your IdP's public key. Never use decode-only.
> - Validate `iss` (issuer), `aud` (audience), and `exp` (expiry) claims.
> - Reject `alg: none` and weak algorithms. Use `RS256` or `ES256`.
> - Example: `jwt.decode(token, public_key, algorithms=["RS256"], audience="your-app")`
> - Never trust tenant_id from the request body. Always extract it from the verified JWT.

### 1b. Add role to AuthContext

Edit the `AuthContext` dataclass in `auth.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class AuthContext:
    api_key: str | None = None
    user_id: str = "anon"
    tenant_id: str = "default"
    role: str = "viewer"  # Add this: "admin", "member", "viewer"
```

---

## Step 2: Add RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Create a permission check dependency. Add to `api/middleware/auth.py`:

```python
from functools import wraps

ROLE_HIERARCHY = {"admin": 3, "member": 2, "viewer": 1}

def require_role(minimum_role: str):
    """FastAPI dependency that enforces a minimum role."""
    def dependency(auth: AuthContext = Depends(verify_api_key)):
        user_level = ROLE_HIERARCHY.get(auth.role, 0)
        required_level = ROLE_HIERARCHY.get(minimum_role, 0)
        if user_level < required_level:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403,
                detail=f"Requires {minimum_role} role (you have {auth.role})",
            )
        return auth
    return dependency
```

Then use it on sensitive routes:

```python
# Anyone can chat
@router.post("/chat")
async def send_message(auth: AuthContext = Depends(verify_api_key)): ...

# Only members can submit round table tasks
@router.post("/round-table/tasks")
async def submit_task(auth: AuthContext = Depends(require_role("member"))): ...

# Only admins can register agents
@router.post("/agents")
async def register_agent(auth: AuthContext = Depends(require_role("admin"))): ...
```

### Recommended route-to-role matrix

Apply `require_role` to every route. Here's the recommended minimum:

| Route | Method | Minimum Role | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `/chat` | POST | viewer | Low-risk, read-oriented |
| `/chat/stream` | POST | viewer | Same as chat |
| `/chat/clear` | POST | member | Modifies state |
| `/chat/escalate` | POST | member | Triggers full round table |
| `/round-table/tasks` | POST | member | Expensive (LLM calls) |
| `/round-table/tasks/{id}` | GET | viewer | Read-only |
| `/round-table/search` | GET | viewer | Read-only |
| `/agents` | GET | viewer | List visible agents |
| `/agents` | POST | admin | Registers new agent |
| `/agents/{id}` | GET | viewer | Read-only |
| `/agents/{id}` | DELETE | admin | Removes agent |
| `/agents/health` | POST | admin | Triggers outbound HTTP |
| `/feedback` | POST | member | Records signals |
| `/feedback` | GET | viewer | Read-only |
| `/preferences` | POST | member | Modifies preferences |
| `/preferences` | GET | viewer | Read-only |
| `/checkins` | GET | viewer | Read-only |
| `/checkins/{id}/respond` | POST | member | Approves/rejects |
| `/webhooks/agents/{id}` | POST | member | Receives agent results |
| `/health` | GET | (public) | K8s probes, no auth |
| `/health/ready` | GET | (public) | K8s probes, no auth |
| `/metrics` | GET | admin | Operational data |
```

## Step 3: Register Team Agents with Visibility

When a team registers their agents, set `visibility` and `tenant_id`:

### Local agents (Python, running in the platform)

```python
# In gateway.py or a team-specific startup script
from src.<project>.agents.registry import AgentEntry

# Team A: private agents (only Team A can use them)
registry.register_local(
    TeamAAnalyst(llm_client=llm_client),
    capabilities=["compliance"],
)
# Manually set visibility after registration
entry = registry.get_entry("team_a_analyst")
entry.visibility = "team"
entry.tenant_id = "team_a"

# Team B: public agents (everyone can use them)
registry.register_local(
    TeamBReviewer(llm_client=llm_client),
    capabilities=["code_review"],
)
# Public by default -- visible to all tenants
```

### Remote agents (any language, running externally)

Teams register their agents via the API:

```bash
# Team C registers a private, sensitive agent
curl -X POST https://platform.example.com/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEAM_C_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "incident_responder",
    "domain": "security incident analysis",
    "base_url": "https://team-c-internal.example.com",
    "capabilities": ["incident_response", "forensics"]
  }'
```

To make the registration respect tenant isolation, update the `register_agent` route to set tenant_id and visibility from the auth context:

```python
# In api/routes/agents.py, after registry.register_remote():
entry = registry.get_entry(registration.name)
entry.tenant_id = auth.tenant_id
entry.visibility = registration.visibility or "team"  # Default to team-private
```

### Visibility rules

| Visibility | Who can see it | Who can use it in round tables |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| `public` | All tenants | Any team's chat or round table |
| `team` | Same tenant only | Only the registering team |
| `private` | Registering user only | Only the specific user |

> **SECURITY: Visibility enforcement checklist**
> - Replace `registry.list_info()` and `registry.get_all()` with `registry.list_for_tenant(auth.tenant_id)` in the `GET /agents` route. Without this, any user can see all agents across tenants.
> - For `private` agents, `list_for_tenant` alone is insufficient -- it filters by tenant but not user. Implement `list_for_user(tenant_id, user_id)` that also checks `entry.user_id == auth.user_id` for private agents.
> - Only platform admins should set `visibility="public"`. Default all new registrations to `"team"`. Reject `visibility="public"` from non-admin callers.
> - Never read `tenant_id` from the request body. Always use `auth.tenant_id` from the verified JWT.
> - Update `_save_remote_agents` and `_load_remote_agents` in `registry.py` to persist `tenant_id` and `visibility` fields. Without this, remote agents revert to `visibility="public"` and `tenant_id="default"` on restart.

---

## Step 4: Isolate Sensitive Teams

For a team like Team C that handles sensitive data (security incidents, legal, HR):

### Data isolation

Sessions, round table results, and transcript search are already keyed by `{tenant_id}:{user_id}:{session_id}` in the chat routes. To complete isolation:

1. **Round table results**: Key the `_results_cache` by `auth.tenant_id`:
   ```python
   cache_key = f"{auth.tenant_id}:{task_id}"
   ```

2. **Transcript search**: The `TranscriptIndexer` stores `tenant_id` in metadata. Filter search results:
   ```python
   results = indexer.search(query=q, ...)
   results.results = [r for r in results.results
                       if r.metadata.get("tenant_id", "default") == auth.tenant_id]
   ```

3. **Feedback and trust**: Already scoped by `project_id` in all database tables. Map `auth.tenant_id` to `project_id` when creating trackers.

### Complete data store isolation checklist

| Data Store | Current Isolation | What You Add |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Chat sessions (`_orchestrators`) | Keyed by `tenant_id:user_id:session_id` | **Already isolated** |
| Round table result cache | Keyed by `task_id` only | Key by `auth.tenant_id:task_id` |
| Transcript search index | Stores `tenant_id` in metadata | Filter results by `auth.tenant_id` |
| Feedback signals (SQLite) | Has `project_id` column | Map `auth.tenant_id` to `project_id` |
| Agent trust scores (SQLite) | Has `project_id` column | Map `auth.tenant_id` to `project_id` |
| User preferences (SQLite) | Has `project_id` column | Map `auth.tenant_id` to `project_id` |
| Check-ins (SQLite) | Has `project_id` column | Map `auth.tenant_id` to `project_id` |
| Vector store (ChromaDB) | Collection per `project_id` | Use `tenant_id` in collection name |
| Agent registry | Has `tenant_id` + `visibility` fields | Use `list_for_tenant()` everywhere |
| LLM usage tracking | Global accumulator | Aggregate by `auth.tenant_id` for billing |

> **SECURITY:** Prefer tenant-scoped queries over post-query filtering. Post-query filtering (e.g., fetching all transcripts then removing other tenants') can leak data through timing side channels, error messages, or log entries. Where possible, pass `tenant_id` into the query itself.

### Agent isolation

Set `visibility="private"` or `"team"` on all of Team C's agents. Update the round table to only include agents visible to the requesting tenant:

```python
# In the submit_task route, before creating the RoundTable:
visible_agents = registry.list_for_tenant(auth.tenant_id)
agents = [e.agent for e in visible_agents if e.healthy]
```

### LLM isolation (optional)

If Team C needs separate LLM credentials (different API key, different model):

```python
# Per-tenant LLM client
tenant_llm_clients = {
    "team_c": create_client(api_key=os.environ["TEAM_C_API_KEY"]),
    "default": create_client(),
}
llm = tenant_llm_clients.get(auth.tenant_id, tenant_llm_clients["default"])
```

---

## Step 5: Connect External Team Agents Safely

When a new department wants to connect their agent to the platform:

### What they need to implement

Three HTTP endpoints (any language):

```
POST /analyze   -- Returns AgentAnalysis JSON
POST /challenge -- Returns AgentChallenge JSON
POST /vote      -- Returns AgentVote JSON
```

See [AGENT_PROTOCOL.md](AGENT_PROTOCOL.md) for the full HTTP contract with JSON schemas and examples.

### What the platform does automatically

- **SSRF protection**: The agent's `base_url` is validated at registration (no private IPs, no cloud metadata endpoints). Note: DNS can change between validation and request time (TOCTOU). For high-assurance deployments, validate IPs at connection time or use an IP allowlist.
- **Response sanitization**: All agent responses are sanitized for prompt injection and size-limited (5MB body, 50K per field)
- **Evidence enforcement**: The enforcement pipeline validates the agent's analysis before it enters the challenge phase
- **Rate limiting**: Per-IP rate limits on all endpoints (per-tenant when you add tenant-based keying)
- **HMAC webhooks**: For async agents, webhook payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256

> **SECURITY: HMAC Webhook Verification**
> - Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in production. Without it, signature verification is skipped entirely.
> - The platform signs the raw request body with `hmac.new(secret, body, sha256)` and sends the signature in `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>`.
> - Agents should verify the signature before processing the payload.
> - For replay protection, include a timestamp in the payload and reject requests older than 5 minutes.
> - Rotate `WEBHOOK_SECRET` periodically. When rotating, accept both old and new secrets during the transition window.

### Onboarding checklist for a new team

1. Team gets a JWT/API key with their `tenant_id` and `role` from your identity provider
2. Team builds their agent (any language) implementing the 3-endpoint protocol
3. Team registers via `POST /api/v1/agents` with their credentials
4. Platform admin sets visibility (`public` if shared, `team` if private)
5. Team's agent now participates in their round tables and chat sessions
6. Core safety agents (Skeptic, Quality, Evidence, FactChecker, Citation) automatically participate alongside the team's agents

## Compliance Considerations for Regulated Industries

If your platform operates in a regulated industry (finance, healthcare, legal, government), AI interactions may be subject to legal discovery, audit, or regulatory review. Consider adding:

### Discoverability awareness

Users interacting with AI agents should be informed that their prompts, agent responses, and round table deliberations may be discoverable in litigation or regulatory proceedings. Common approaches:

- **Chat banner**: Persistent, non-dismissable notice above the chat input (e.g., *"All prompts and AI outputs are potentially discoverable in litigation or regulatory proceedings."*)
- **Round table notice**: Same banner above the round table task submission
- **API response header**: `X-AI-Discoverability-Notice` header on all AI-generated responses
- **Export disclaimer**: Discoverability paragraph appended to any exported reports or artifacts

### Audit trail

The scaffold already writes round table artifacts as JSON and indexes transcripts for search. For regulated deployments, consider adding:

- **Prompt/response hash logging**: SHA-256 hash of every prompt and response stored in a tamper-evident audit database, separate from the application database
- **Immutable storage**: Write artifacts to append-only storage (S3 with object lock, immutable database tables)
- **Timestamp attestation**: Cryptographic timestamps on artifacts for non-repudiation

### Legal hold

When litigation or regulatory investigation is anticipated, log deletion must stop. Consider:

- **Legal hold flag**: Environment variable or config that disables all log cleanup, cache eviction, and data retention policies when active
- **Hold notification**: Log a warning on startup when legal hold is active so operators are aware

### Data retention

Define retention policies for each data store and document them for your legal/compliance team:

| Data Store | Default Retention | Regulatory Consideration |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Chat sessions | In-memory (lost on restart) | May need persistent storage for compliance |
| Round table artifacts | Filesystem (permanent) | Define retention period with legal team |
| Transcript search index | ChromaDB (permanent) | Subject to discovery; include in hold policy |
| Feedback signals | SQLite (permanent) | May contain PII; subject to GDPR/CCPA |
| Agent trust scores | SQLite (permanent) | Audit trail for routing decisions |

> **Note:** These are considerations for your legal and compliance team to evaluate. The scaffold provides the infrastructure hooks -- your organization defines the policies.
