# External Agent Protocol

How to build an agent in **any language** (TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python, etc.) that participates in the round table and chat orchestrator.

Your agent implements 3 HTTP endpoints. The platform calls them during deliberation.

## POST /analyze

The platform sends your agent a task to analyze independently.

### Request

```json
{
  "task_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "content": "Review the authentication module for security vulnerabilities",
  "context": {
    "source": "round_table",
    "agent_focus_areas": {"your_agent": "security review"}

## POST /challenge

The platform sends other agents' analyses for your agent to challenge.

### Request

```json
{
  "task_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "content": "Review the authentication module for security vulnerabilities",
  "other_analyses": [
    {
      "agent_name": "code_reviewer",
      "domain": "code quality",
      "observations": [
        {
          "finding": "Authentication logic is well-structured",
          "evidence": "Clean separation of concerns in auth module",
          "severity": "info",
          "confidence": 0.7
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "agent_name": "security_analyst",
  "challenges": [
    {
      "target_agent": "code_reviewer",
      "finding_challenged": "Authentication logic is well-structured",
      "counter_evidence": "Structure is clean but the SQL query on line 42 uses string interpolation, which is a critical vulnerability regardless of code organization"
    }
  ],
  "concessions": [
    {
      "target_agent": "code_reviewer",
      "finding_accepted": "Clean separation of concerns",
      "reason": "The module boundary design is sound; the vulnerability is in implementation, not architecture"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_name` | string | yes | Your agent's name |
| `challenges` | object[] | no | Findings you disagree with (must include counter-evidence) |
| `concessions` | object[] | no | Findings you agree with (explain why) |

---

## POST /vote

The platform sends the synthesized recommendation for your agent to approve or dissent.

### Request

```json
{
  "task_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "content": "Review the authentication module for security vulnerabilities",
  "synthesis": {
    "recommended_direction": "Fix SQL injection vulnerability and add rate limiting before deployment",
    "key_findings": [
      {"agent_name": "security_analyst", "finding": "SQL injection on line 42", "evidence": "..."}
    ],
    "trade_offs": ["Rate limiting may impact legitimate high-volume API users"],
    "minority_views": []
  }
}
```

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "agent_name": "security_analyst",
  "approve": true,
  "conditions": [
    "SQL injection fix must use parameterized queries, not escaping"
  ],
  "dissent_reason": null
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_name` | string | yes | Your agent's name |
| `approve` | boolean | yes | `true` to approve, `false` to dissent |
| `conditions` | string[] | no | Conditions for your approval |
| `dissent_reason` | string | no | Why you dissent (required if `approve` is false) |

---

## Authentication

The platform sends your agent's API key (set during registration) in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-agent-api-key>
```

If you didn't set an API key during registration, no Authorization header is sent.

## Timeouts

The platform waits **120 seconds** (configurable) for each endpoint. If your agent doesn't respond in time, it's marked as failed for that phase and excluded from the round table result.

## Response Size Limits

- Maximum response body: **5 MB**
- Maximum per-field string length: **50,000 characters**
- Responses exceeding these limits are truncated or rejected.

## Error Handling

| Your response | Platform behavior |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 200 with valid JSON | Used in deliberation |
| 200 with invalid JSON | Logged as warning, agent excluded from this phase |
| 4xx or 5xx | Logged as error, agent excluded from this phase |
| Timeout (>120s) | Agent marked unhealthy, excluded |

The platform never crashes because of a single agent failure. Other agents continue the deliberation.

## Response Sanitization

All responses from external agents are automatically:
- Scanned for prompt injection patterns (logged if detected)
- Stripped of null bytes
- Truncated to size limits
- Run through the evidence enforcement pipeline (banned speculation patterns flagged)

## Registration

Register your agent with the platform:

```bash
curl -X POST https://platform.example.com/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "security_analyst",
    "domain": "application security",
    "base_url": "https://your-agent.example.com",
    "api_key": "your-agent-secret",
    "capabilities": ["security", "owasp", "code_review"],
    "mode": "sync"
  }'
```

After registration, your agent participates in all round tables and chat sessions where its domain is relevant.

## Quick Example: Minimal Agent (Python)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/analyze")
async def analyze(request: dict):
    return {
        "agent_name": "my_agent",
        "domain": "general",
        "observations": [{
            "finding": f"Analyzed: {request['content'][:100]}",
            "evidence": "[INDICATED: input_text] Based on provided content",
            "severity": "info",
            "confidence": 0.5,
        }],
    }

@app.post("/challenge")
async def challenge(request: dict):
    return {"agent_name": "my_agent", "challenges": [], "concessions": []}

@app.post("/vote")
async def vote(request: dict):
    return {"agent_name": "my_agent", "approve": True, "conditions": []}
```

Run with: `uvicorn my_agent:app --port 3001`

Then register: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "my_agent", "domain": "general", "base_url": "http://localhost:3001"}'`
