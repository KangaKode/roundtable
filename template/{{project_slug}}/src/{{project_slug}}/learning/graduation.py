GraduationEngine -- Promotes stable patterns from project-level to global-level.

When a preference or trust score has been consistent across N sessions,
the engine suggests graduating it to the global profile so it applies
to all future projects.

Uses a pluggable GraduationRule protocol. Ships with one built-in rule:
  - ConsistencyRule: promotes preferences stable across N sessions

Projects add domain-specific rules by implementing the protocol.
Graduation ALWAYS requires user confirmation via CheckInManager.

Keep this file under 200 lines.
