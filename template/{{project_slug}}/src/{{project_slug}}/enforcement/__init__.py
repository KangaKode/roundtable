"""
Evidence Enforcement Pipeline -- validates agent responses for quality and honesty.

Runs after each agent's analysis (Phase 1) and before challenge (Phase 2).
Responses that fail validation are auto-corrected via LLM correction prompt.

Components:
  - FactChecker: Scans for banned speculation/opinion/hedging language
  - EvidenceLevelEnforcer: Validates VERIFIED/CORROBORATED/INDICATED/POSSIBLE format
  - CitationValidator: Checks that cited sources exist (pluggable)
  - MathVerifier: Validates numeric claims against ground truth (pluggable)
  - EvidenceEnforcementPipeline: Orchestrates all validators with reject-and-rewrite
