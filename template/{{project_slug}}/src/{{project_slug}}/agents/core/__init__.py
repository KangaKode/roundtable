"""
Core safety agents -- meta-agents that ensure deliberation quality.

These agents automatically participate in every round table session.
They evaluate the process (reasoning, completeness, evidence) rather
than the domain content. Disable with include_core_agents=False in
RoundTableConfig if you have a specific reason to opt out.

Five core agents:
  - Skeptic: challenges assumptions, demands evidence
  - Quality: tracks requirement coverage, finds gaps
  - Evidence: grades claim strength, flags speculation
  - FactChecker: challenges speculation language in deliberation
  - Citation: enforces evidence level tagging on all findings
