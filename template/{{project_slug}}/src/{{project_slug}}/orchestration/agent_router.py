"""
AgentRouter -- Selects which specialists to consult for a given query.

Used by the ChatOrchestrator to pick 1-3 relevant agents instead of
involving all agents (which is the RoundTable's job).

Routing strategies:
  1. Domain matching: match query keywords against agent domains
  2. Trust-weighted: prefer agents with higher trust scores (when learning system is active)
  3. Capability matching: match against agent capability tags

The router is intentionally simple -- a lead agent (LLM) makes the final
decision. This module provides candidate selection; the orchestrator decides.

Keep this file under 200 lines.
